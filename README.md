# Plugins for Insult Order

## Plugins Description
**IOMozaicFree**: "Uncensores" or rather it removes mozaics from the private parts

**IOTextureReplacer**: Replaces Textures based on filename (currently only png files supported)
  - PNG files must be placed into /bepinex/images directory with their original filename
  - Press Alt+F11 do dump all textures from the current scene into /bepinex/dump/*scenename*

## Installation
Make sure you only install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) **or** [IPA](https://github.com/Eusth/IPA).
**NOT BOTH**; they might conflict each other and as result nothing will work.
